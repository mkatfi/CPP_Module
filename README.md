![CPP_Module Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af2b59f-14a1-4c81-9e24-830f6cf978e2)


*A comprehensive journey into C++ programming, object-oriented design, and advanced programming concepts.*  

---

## Overview  

The **CPP_Module** project is part of the 1337 School curriculum, designed to introduce students to C++ and its advanced features. It focuses on learning object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, memory management, and modern programming techniques. Each module builds upon the previous ones, gradually exploring deeper and more complex topics in C++ development.  

---

## Objectives  

- Master the C++ programming language.  
- Understand and apply **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts.  
- Learn about C++ features such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and more.  
- Explore advanced topics like **templates**, **operator overloading**, and **smart pointers**.  
- Develop clean, modular, and maintainable code following best practices.  

---

## Modules Overview  

The project is divided into multiple modules, each addressing specific aspects of C++ programming:  

### **Module 00**:  
- Introduction to C++.  
- Learning about namespaces, classes, member functions, and non-member attributes.  

### **Module 01**:  
- Deep dive into memory allocation and references.  
- Understanding the importance of constructors and destructors.  

### **Module 02**:  
- Adopting polymorphism, inheritance, and abstract classes.  
- Designing flexible and reusable object hierarchies.  

### **Module 03**:  
- Overloading operators.  
- Exploring the nuances of copy constructors and assignment operators.  

### **Module 04**:  
- Mastering templates and generic programming.  
- Building reusable code for multiple data types.  

### **Module 05**:  
- Exception handling in C++.  
- Writing robust and error-resistant code.  

### **Module 06**:  
- Introduction to type casting and its different forms: `dynamic_cast`, `static_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and `const_cast`.  

### **Module 07**:  
- Utilizing the Standard Template Library (STL).  
- Working with containers such as `vector`, `map`, `set`, and algorithms like `sort` and `find`.  

### **Module 08**:  
- Exploring smart pointers like `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`.  
- Proper memory management to prevent leaks and dangling pointers.

## Installation and Compilation  

### Prerequisites:  
Ensure you have a working C++ compiler (such as `g++`) and `make` installed.  

### Compilation:  

To compile a specific module, navigate to the corresponding folder and run:  

```bash  
make  
```  

### Running the program:  

```bash  
./program_name  
```

## Code Example  

Here's a simple example of a class in C++:  

```cpp  
#include <iostream>  

class Example {  
public:  
    Example() {  
        std::cout << "Constructor called!" << std::endl;  
    }  

    ~Example() {  
        std::cout << "Destructor called!" << std::endl;  
    }  

    void greet() {  
        std::cout << "Hello, CPP_Module!" << std::endl;  
    }  
};  

int main() {  
    Example obj;  
    obj.greet();  
    return 0;  
}  
```
