*A journey into mastering C++ programming, object-oriented design, and advanced features.*  

---

## Overview  

The **CPP_Module** is part of the 1337 School curriculum, designed to teach advanced C++ programming concepts. Students progressively learn object-oriented programming (OOP), memory management, and modern techniques through hands-on modules.  

---

## Modules  

- **Module 00**: C++ Basics — Namespaces, classes, and member functions.  
- **Module 01**: Memory allocation, constructors, and destructors.  
- **Module 02**: Polymorphism, inheritance, and abstract classes.  
- **Module 03**: Operator overloading and copy constructors.  
- **Module 04**: Templates and generic programming.  
- **Module 05**: Exception handling.  
- **Module 06**: Advanced type casting.  
- **Module 07**: Standard Template Library (STL) basics.  
- **Module 08**: Smart pointers and memory management.  
- **Module 09**: Advanced STL use cases — Containers, algorithms, and iterators.

## Key Features  

- Master OOP concepts: inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  
- Learn modern C++ techniques: templates, exception handling, and type casting.  
- Utilize STL for efficient programming with containers and algorithms.  
- Develop robust, modular, and maintainable code.
